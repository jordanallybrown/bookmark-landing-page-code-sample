# Frontend Mentor - Bookmark landing page code sample

This is my rapid prototyping code sample for [Bookmark landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/bookmark-landing-page-5d0b588a9edda32581d29158). For the quick prototype, I included the responsive layout and tabbed feature. You can find the design reference files under the design folder.

## My process

- Examining Figma file / style guides
- CSS custom properties and utility classes
- Flexbox & CSS Grid
- Responsive for Desktop and mobile screens
